# Live webpages:
- There are currently two different versions of the webpage, which are identical except for the map.  Version 1 has a map that centers on the inputted location, but shows no weather information.  Version 2 has a map that shows current temperature, but doesn't center when the user inputs a location.
- The homepage is just a mock-up of what we'd like the homepage to look like if we made it a real website, so none of the external links actually go anywhere.
- Click the "Compare the Weather" button at the top of the page to get weather forecasts.
- Version 1: http://web.simmons.edu/~scheffm/Sharkhack2018/Version%201/
- Version 2: http://web.simmons.edu/~scheffm/Sharkhack2018/Version%202/
- The above links will cease to function at some point after May 2018.  They're currently hosted on a free webspace that has been provided to me by my school, so they will cease to exist at some point after I graduate (which happens in May).
